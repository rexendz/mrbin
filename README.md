# Machine for Recycling Bottles with Incentive Noting
#                    (MR BIN)

MR BIN is our thesis project for our senior year in ADZU
It is a smart trash bin that can detect PET bottles and measure its volume, while rejecting other materials that are not PET BOTTLES
After the device successfully scans the PET bottle, it will then compress the PET bottle and store it inside the bin
When a user successfully transacted using our device, it will give out incentives to that user (Incentive Noting)
